## STAT 532 

Welcome to _Bayesian Statistics_, STAT 532! 

### Course Description

This course is intended to introduce you to the philosophy, theory, and application of Bayesian Statistics and inference. Our course text will provide an excellent resourse for you from the introductory material we will cover during this course all the way through advanced topics in applied Bayesian Statistics. All examples in the text are motivated by _real data_ and the authors do an excellent job discussing practical implications for modeling decisions in the context of each research question. It is my goal to guide you through the introductory material so that you can leave the course with a solid foundation to continue research and application of more advanced topics that are presented later in the text. 

### Pre-requisites 

- STAT 502 (or STAT 422) and STAT 506 stongly recommended. The ability to write custom functions in the \textsf{R} programming language (R Core Team, 2019) is assumed.

- Excecuting Bayesian calculus requires the understanding of numerical integration, and computational skills to program algorithms to approximate complex integrals in multiple dimensions. Thus, a good portion of this course will be discussing computational techinques for simulating posterior distributions.

### Course Learning Outcomes

- Demonstrate a basic understanding of the fundamental concepts underlying Bayesian inference
- Demonstrate connections and make comparisons among frequentist, likelihood, and Bayesian methods, both from a practical and philosophical perspective
- Demonstrate an understanding of the complex issues involved in specifying prior distributions and recognize there is no "default" prior
- Demonstrate ability to program methods for taking samples from posterior distributions, including rejection sampling, Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, and Gibbs sampling
- Understand the concepts underlying the computation approaches, including Hamiltonian Monte Carlo techniques
- Demonstrate ability to use available and common software to carry out Bayesian data analysis
- Demonstrate ability to write about conceptual issues, describe and justify assumptions and decisions, and interpret results
- Demonstrate ability to use creative and appropriate graphics to display raw data and results from statistical models
- Demonstrate ability to write down sophisticated models with standard notation, recognizing there are multiple ways to write the same analysis
- Explain the idea behind multi-level, or hierarchical, models and how they relate to models used in traditional linear models classes
- Demonstrate an understanding of posterior predictive checks, as well as the ability to use them meaningfully in practice
- Demonstrate a willingness to think about and discuss the foundations of statistical inference
